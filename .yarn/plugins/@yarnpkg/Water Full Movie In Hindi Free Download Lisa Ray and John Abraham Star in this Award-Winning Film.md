The film follows the story of Chuyia, an 8-year-old girl who becomes a widow and is sent to a home for widows, where she meets Kalyani, a young and beautiful widow who is forced into prostitution by the ashram's leader, Madhumati. Chuyia also befriends Shakuntala, a wise and compassionate widow who questions the oppressive traditions that bind them. Chuyia's life changes when she introduces Kalyani to Narayan, a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, who falls in love with her and wants to marry her. However, their love faces many obstacles and tragedies as they try to break free from the social restrictions imposed on widows.
 
Water is a powerful and poignant film that exposes the plight of widows in India, who are treated as outcasts and exploited by society. The film also depicts the rise of Gandhi's movement for independence and social reform, and how it challenges the status quo. The film features stunning cinematography, authentic costumes and sets, and brilliant performances by the cast, especially Sarala as Chuyia, Lisa Ray as Kalyani, Seema Biswas as Shakuntala, and John Abraham as Narayan.
